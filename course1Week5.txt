Course 1: Week 5 Basics Of PHP

-------------------------------
PHP Keywords:
All variables start with a $
Case matters;
$name is different than $Name

Strings:

Strings can be single or double quotes. They are different however.

Consider double quote strings as smart strings
backslash is esc character (\)
concatenation is . and not +

output :
echo: can be treated like a function with one parameter.

print: is a function.  Only one parameter, but parentheses are optional, so it can look like a language construct.
